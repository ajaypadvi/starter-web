Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Why did you go to the police? Why didn't you come to me first? My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator. Only don't tell me you're innocent. Because it insults my intelligence and makes me very angry. Te salut, Don Corleone.

I know it was you, Fredo. You broke my heart. You broke my heart! Don't you know that I would use all of my power to prevent something like that from happening? What's wrong with being a lawyer? You can act like a man!

Very well. You want to do business with me. I will do business with you. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. The hotel, the casino. The Corleone Family wants to buy you out. When they come... they come at what you love.

t's not personal. It's business. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? We're both part of the same hypocrisy, senator, but never think it applies to my family.
